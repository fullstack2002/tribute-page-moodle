      <h2>Here's a time line of my experience working with Moodle</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>March 2020 the covid pandemic made us switch to online studying at uni so we started using moodle for some classes</li>
        <li>June 2020 exams season, we were told that if we go to another tab during test to google answers it will end and the result would be 0%</li>
        <li>September 2020 new semester started, we started saving answers if test showed results to use them on exams later and it helped me through uni a lot</li>
        <li>January 2021, exams season, moodle died a lot when there were too many people having exams at the same time so some of exmas had to be rescheduled some exams had so many parts of tasks so it was harder to figure out how to do the exam than actually do the exam. We also had to add word files or photos of handwritten task solving notes and it wasn`t easy to figure out how to do that cause after you hand in the exam you can`t change the answer even if you just added it wrong but solved the task right</li>
        <li>February 2021, there was an option to see results of each exam part in moodle right after they were checked before it`s published anywhere else but it was so hard to find that page</li>
        <li>June 2021 exam season again, we were told about this new thing, if you dont have any activity on a webpage for 5 minutes, the test ends and your result would be 0%, so instead of solving the task you are worried about this 5 minute thing and you`re distracted from exam all the time cause you have to type something random in the answer field so exam wouldn`t end itself</li>
        <li>October 2021 I switched to online studying (so even if quarantine ends I will study online only) so I had even more experience with moodle to have now. Moodle`s appearance and functionality changed a lot for the new semester so it took time to figure out what the hell happened to it and how to use the new version. I also learned that you can text people (for example teachers) on moodle, but in my experience they don`t reply faster than they do with emails even if they`re online on moodle</li>
        <li>November 2021 texted teachers a lot because we had so many tests closed semester ago, a year ago, sometimes even a few years ago but the deadline in the description of the task was this semester
        </li>
        <li>Did a 90% of course in 24 hours because teacher thought we weren`t his students even though we told him that we were so we had to catch up on it quickly when he finally found out that he is our teacher for this course</li>
        <li>January 2022 something happened with the page where you have all classes of the semester and your total score on each of them so like I had one number there and completely different on the total score page in the couse</li>
        <li>May 2022 had a lot of courses with wrong dates. Some tests were closed before I got accepted to uni</li>
        <li>September 2022 found front end bugs. Our uni`s moodle and website never really worked well but adding pictures to decorate website in a wrong way and wrong file format doesn`t really help the situation but makes it worse. I don`t really care if we have a cute website, a well working study platform is a lot better than a good-looking but barely working one</li>
        <li>November 2022 it barely worked cause uni didn`t have electricity and servers are located there</li>
        <li>December 2022 it barely worked again, died when I was doing the test, answers weren`t saved, I emailed the teacher but it`s definately gonna fuck up my total grade on this course</li>
        <li>January 2023 the uni`s website is working but moodle died which is weird cause if servers are ok they both work idk what`s the problem but our moodle is dead and it inspired me to do this project</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Conclusion of my experience</h3>
      <p>I really want to believe that moodle is a great lms platform. I`ve met a lot of people who hate it. I think it`s because people who are responsible for moodle in some universities just don`t know how to do their job or don`t want to? I checked the latest moodle version and it doesn`t look like the one we are using. A lot of unpleasant experience I got from courses with fucked up deadline dates, order of tasks, missing files. So the problems are disorganized teachers and people from our uni who are responsible for tech support. The functionality of the lms is ok for me. All the problems like having less minutes than tasks on a test so it`s impossible to read all suggested answers, I`m not even saying anything about time to think or not being able to see your mistakes on a test, these things really depend on teachers only, it`s not the system.</p>
